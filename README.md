# Random-Names-JavaScript

[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/LFeh/1500-translator.svg)](./license.md)

I've decided to create the Random Names to create a possible new name with the combination of two words.
The result is based on these names with random letters of them.
I've writed this code with **JavaScript**, **CSS Grid** and **Webpack** to pratice my skills whith these tools.
Feel free to use the code or add more features.
